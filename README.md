# fork notes

### THIS FORK WILL NOT BE MAINTAINED OR UPDATED.

#### I suggest using [ArtBot](https://github.com/daveschumaker/artbot-for-stable-diffusion) instead üòè


This is a fork of aqualxx/stable-ui, an unmaintained frontend for <a href="https://aihorde.net">AI Horde</a> 
crowd-sourced stable diffusion. It contains all the same bugs and limitations the original stable-ui 
contains, but has been updated to support SDXL, ~~which currently requires a batch size of 2~~, and recommends a 
minimum of 1024x1024. ~~Instead of updating this properly, I've simply added a check to see if the model 
includes SDXL, and changed the requested number of images to 2; that means for every 1 SDXL image you 
request here, you'll get 2 images back instead of 1.~~ The only niceties I've added beyond this is to set the 
default model to SDXL and the defaults size to 1024x1024. Everything else is the same.

Update: I applied a fix to the leaderboard, [as found by @super.skirv on Discord](https://discord.com/channels/781145214752129095/1107629376889172098/1157447364827697182).

Update: I applied a fix to space out requests because horde now has a rate limit on async endpoints. Since Horde 
now supports SDXL officially, I also swapped out sdxl_beta model name for SDXL 1.0 and removed the inpainting 
and image amount overrides from it.

# stable-ui üî•

[Stable UI](https://aqualxx.github.io/stable-ui/) is a web user interface designed to generate, save, and view images using Stable Diffusion, with the goal being able to provide Stable Diffusion to anyone for 100% free.

This is achieved using [Stable Horde](https://stablehorde.net/), a crowdsourced distributed cluster of Stable Diffusion workers, which makes this tool available for anyone to use regardless if they don't have the processing power to run Stable Diffusion themselves.
