It contains all the same bugs and limitations the original stable-ui contains, but has been updated to support SDXL; the only niceties I&#39;ve added beyond this is to set the default model to SDXL and the defaults size to 1024x1024. Everything else is the same.</div><div data-v-4b3e5287>Update: I applied a fix to the leaderboard, <a href="https://discord.com/channels/781145214752129095/1107629376889172098/1157447364827697182" data-v-4b3e5287> as found by @super.skirv on Discord</a>. </div><div data-v-4b3e5287>Update: I applied a fix to space out requests because horde now has a rate limit on async endpoints. Since Horde now supports SDXL officially, I also swapped out sdxl_beta model name for SDXL 1.0 and removed the inpainting and image amount overrides from it.</div><div data-v-4b3e5287>Jan. 8, 2024: Added LoRa/TI support. In your prompt, use the syntax `&lt;lora:id:strength&gt;` or `&lt;ti:id&gt;` to add them to your request. For LoRas, put a &#39;v&#39; before the id to use the version id instead. Not that for both loras and tis, only integer ids are supported. (Added by rbrtcs1)</div><div data-v-4b3e5287>Update: I added LCM sampler.
