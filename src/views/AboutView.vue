        <div>I suggest you use <a href="https://tinybots.net/artbot">ArtBot</a> instead, it's much nicer. aren't you glad I put this here and not as a pop-up alert every time you load this site? I think that was really nice of me üëç</div>
        <h1 style="margin-top: 0">Efreak's fork</h1>
        <h3 style="margin-top: 0">THIS FORK WILL NOT BE MAINTAINED OR UODATED</h3>
        <div>This is a fork of aqualxx/stable-ui, an unmaintained frontend for <a href="https://aihorde.net">AI Horde</a> crowd-sourced stable diffusion. It contains all the same bugs and limitations the original stable-ui contains, but has been updated to support SDXL, which currently requires a batch size of 2, and recommends a minimum of 1024x1024. Instead of updating this properly, I've simply added a check to see if the model includes SDXL, and changed the requested number of images to 2; that means for every 1 SDXL image you request here, you'll get 2 images back instead of 1. The only niceties I've added beyond this is to set the default model to SDXL and the defaults size to 1024x1024. Everything else is the same.</div>
        <div>Update: I applied a fix to the leaderboard, <a href="https://discord.com/channels/781145214752129095/1107629376889172098/1157447364827697182>as found by @super.skirv on Discord</a>. </div>
        <div>Update: I applied a fix to space out requests because horde now has a rate limit on async endpoints. Since Horde now supports SDXL officially, I also swapped out sdxl_beta model name for SDXL 1.0 and removed the inpainting and image amount overrides from it.</div>

        <h1 style="margin-top: 0">Stable UI</h1>
        <div>This tool provides a front-end for generating free Stable Diffusion images without needing any special hardware. While Stable UI was originally created as a way to explore web APIs and <BaseLink href="https://vuejs.org/">Vue</BaseLink>, it has since evolved into a tool that allows users to easily access Stable Diffusion to create fascinating images!</div><br>

            <h2>FAQ</h2>
            <h3>What is Stable Horde?</h3>
            <span>Stable Horde is an open source project that allows anyone to use Stable Diffusion - for free! For those who want the specifics, it's powered by a <BaseLink href="https://github.com/db0/AI-Horde">crowdsourced distributed cluster</BaseLink> of <BaseLink href="https://github.com/Sygil-Dev/nataili">Stable Diffusion workers</BaseLink>. Consider <BaseLink href="https://github.com/db0/AI-Horde/blob/main/README_StableHorde.md">joining the horde yourself</BaseLink>! You can join the Stable Horde <BaseLink href="https://discord.gg/3DxrhksKzn">discord server</BaseLink> or support its development on <BaseLink href="https://www.patreon.com/db0">Patreon</BaseLink> or <BaseLink href="https://github.com/db0">Github</BaseLink>.</span>
            <h3>How do I increase my generation speed?</h3>
            <span>If you want prioritized generations, you may <BaseLink href="https://stablehorde.net/register">register</BaseLink> an account. This will give an API key that can be used to generate images on this site or others. Make sure to never share this key! Anonymous/non-registered users have the lowest priority in the queue, resulting in slower generation times. Your API key is set to connect anonymously by default; you can change this behaviour through the settings tab. To increase your priority futher, try increasing your Kudos by setting up a worker or by contributing and being gifted by the kind fellows in the discord server.</span>
            <h3>Why has my IP address been put in timeout?</h3>
            <span>This error occurs when your prompt has been flagged as unethical - it's to protect the Horde from the worst of the worst. To fix this error, try changing or removing words from your prompt that could be deemed as such.</span>
